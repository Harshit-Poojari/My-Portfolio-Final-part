            <p class="text-muted text-left">The Shree Siddhivinayak Ganapati Mandir is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shri Ganesh. It is located in Prabhadevi, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. It was originally built by Laxman Vithu and Deubai Patil on 19 November 1801. It is one of the richest temples in India The temple has a small mandap with the shrine for Siddhi Vinayak ("Ganesha who grants your wish"). The wooden doors to the sanctum are carved with images of the Ashtavinayak (the eight manifestations of Ganesha in Maharashtra). The inner roof of the sanctum is plated with gold, and the central statue is of Ganesha. In the periphery, there is a Hanuman temple as well. The exterior of the temple consists of a dome which is lit up with multiple colors in the evenings and they keep changing every few hours. The statue of Shri Ganesha is located exactly under the dome.</p>

            <p>A treat for the eye, if not for the mind, Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior, co-produced by lead actor Ajay Devgn, is a 3D period biopic that gives historicity a wide berth and pieces together a dramatic enactment of a 17th century Maratha conquest of a strategic fort under the control of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. The makers of the film do admit as much in an upfront disclaimer upfront to cover their tracks and assuage any outrage that might be caused by the liberties that they have taken.</p>

            <p>Watched today on television it was thrilling actually. Real good work by the actors and the research work by jp Dutta is truly appreciating. In Sikkim we have a temple named Harbhajan Singh also in the movie a captain also named by the same who died after showing bravery on the battlefield but I don't know both are same soldier or not. They say hindu China bhai bhai - buy on reality that not seems true at all and Chinese soldiers are cunning and not truest worthy at all. In 1963 & 1967 we learned many things on Chinese army & their strategy now in future we must be prepare for such unfortunate condition.
